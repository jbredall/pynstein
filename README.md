pynstein: Special Relativity in Python
=======

**Version:** 0.1.0

**Author:** John Bredall

**Description:** A package that includes simple functions for working with 4-vectors, such as Lorentz transformations, finding gamma, and converting from 3-velocity to 4-velocity.

## Future Plans:

1. Create 4-vector object with built-in functions

2. Add 4-momentum

3. Beautify code
